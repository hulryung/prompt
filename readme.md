# dkkang's bash prompt
This is a bash prompt for my personal use.
This prompt shows following information.
- full path of current directory
- git branch name
- current user name
- current host name
- current time

This prompt and install script is only tested on Ubuntu 22.04
but, it will work on other linux distributions those use bash shell.


## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hulryung/prompts.git
$ cd prompts
$ ./install.sh
```

## Usage
After installation, you can use this prompt by opening a new terminal.
If you want to use it immediately, type following command.

```bash
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

## Caution
The .bashrc file will be overwritten by this script
so if you have your own .bashrc file, you should backup it.

## License
Free to use, copy, modify, distribute, etc.
